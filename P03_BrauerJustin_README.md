# UnityKrakenGame - Quest Controller Dev Tool

I had a lot of difficulty trying to add a completed quest scriptable object, 
I tried a number of different iterations to take the information from QuestJournal and port it over to a new object for storage.

After failing to implement it I cleaned up what I had, it had dawned on me that the method of storing the completed quests may differ
from game to game so I figured it would be okay to leave it out. 

Other than that the other challenges I faced with the project were eventually worked out and resolved, 
this was surprisingly fun to work on.

Lastly, I decided to leave the flowers in the scene I had originally made to test that the repository was working. 
They are totally optional and please feel free to remove them from the scene and assets folder as needed.
